Description: microsimr provides functions for simulating microsatellite data under
            a coalescent using Hudson's ms program. The user is able to analyze
            the simulated data directly within R. There is also the option of
            outputting the simulated data in a format suitable for Migrate-N.
            Functions to output simulated data in other formats can be added
            upon request (e.g., IMa2 or LAMARC). Currently, microsimr only
            simulates microsatellite data under a symmetrical strict stepwise
            mutation model. Other mutation models can be considered if there is
            interest.
